MyMvcNetCore: A Sample E-Commerce Application
This project is a practical example of a clean and scalable architecture for a .NET Core 9.0 application. It leverages the Unit of Work and Repository design patterns to effectively manage data access and business logic. The primary goal is to ensure the application is robust, maintainable, and easy to test.

Core Concepts and Features
This solution is built around key architectural principles that promote a clean, organized, and efficient codebase.
•	Separation of Concerns: The project is divided into distinct, self-contained layers. This prevents components from becoming tightly coupled, making the application easier to maintain and scale.
•	Repository Pattern: This pattern provides a clear abstraction layer over data access. It allows the business logic to interact with data using a common set of methods (like GetAll or GetById) without needing to know the specifics of the underlying database technology.
•	Unit of Work: This ensures that multiple data operations within a single business task are treated as an atomic transaction. All changes are either committed together or rolled back completely if any part of the operation fails, guaranteeing data integrity.
•	Dependency Injection: By using .NET Core's built-in dependency injection, the project promotes loose coupling. Services and repositories are injected as interfaces, making the code more modular and significantly easier to unit test.

Project Structure
The solution is organized into several logical projects (layers), each with a specific role.
•	MyMvcNetCore.Entities: This is the data model layer. It defines all the core entities for the application, such as Category, Product, and Order, without any logic or data access implementation.
•	MyMvcNetCore.DataAccess: This is the dedicated data access layer. It's responsible for all communication with the database.
o	MyMvcNetCoreDbContext: The main DbContext for Entity Framework Core.
o	Migrations: Contains the database migration scripts.
o	Repository: Houses the concrete implementations of the repository pattern.
o	UnitOfWork: Implements the IUnitOfWork interface to coordinate repositories and manage transactions.
•	MyMvcNetCore.Services: This layer contains the core business logic. Classes like CategoryService.cs orchestrate operations by using the IUnitOfWork to interact with multiple repositories.
•	MyMvcNetCore.ViewModels: This layer defines the data models used for the views. It's crucial for separating the domain models from the presentation layer, ensuring that only necessary data is sent to the front end.
•	MyMvcNetCore.Web: This is the presentation layer.
o	Controllers: Handle incoming HTTP requests and coordinate with the services layer.
o	Views: Provide the user interface, displaying data from the ViewModels.
